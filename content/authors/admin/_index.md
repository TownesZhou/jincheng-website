Jincheng Zhou is a graduate student at the University of Southern California. I currently work as a student worker at the Sigma Cognitive Architecture lab in the USC Institute for Creative Technologies.  

I am generally interested in Artificial General Intelligence, i.e., building a human-like, knowledge-based, generally intelligent system. At the current stage, my specific research interests are in cognitive architectures, cognitive modeling, deep & multi-agent reinforcement learning, probabilistic programming, probabilistic graphical models, knowledge representation & repreesntation learning, and causal reasoning. I believe research breakthroughs in these areas will be critical to the engineering of a next-generation integrated architecture of artificial intelligence.
