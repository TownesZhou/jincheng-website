I am a CS Ph.D. student at Purdue University advised by [Professor Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/) in the [PurdueMINDS Lab](https://minds.science.purdue.edu/). Before joining Purdue, I was working with [Professor Paul Rosenbloom](https://sites.usc.edu/rosenbloom/) and [Dr. Volkan Ustun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/volkan-ustun-9883a74) at the Sigma cognitive architecture lab in the [USC Institute for Creative Technologies](https://ict.usc.edu/). I received the Computer Science Outstanding Student Award from USC Viterbi School of Engineering when graduating with a B.S. degree in CS.

I am currently interested in graph representation learning and its application to reasoning in knowledge graphs, causal inference and causal structural discovery, meta learning, and artificial general intelligence. My past research has also involved cognitive architectures, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and probabilistic graphical models & programming. I believe research breakthroughs in all these areas will be critical to the development of a next-generation integrated architecture of artificial general intelligence.
