Jincheng Zhou is a graduate student at the University of Southern California. I currently work as a student worker at the Sigma Cognitive Architecture lab in the USC Institute for Creative Technologies. I received the Computer Science Outstanding Student Award from USC Viterbi School of Engineering when graduating with a B.S. degree in CS. 

I am generally interested in Artificial General Intelligence, i.e., building a human-like, knowledge-based, generally intelligent system. I believe this is the single most important technological breakthrough in the entirety of human history. My past research has been revolving around cognitive architectures, cognitive modeling, deep & multi-agent reinforcement learning, probabilistic graphical models & programming. At the current stage, I am also interested in knowledge representation & represntation learning, causal reasoning, and natural language processing. I believe research breakthroughs in all these areas will be critical to the engineering of a next-generation integrated architecture of artificial general intelligence.
